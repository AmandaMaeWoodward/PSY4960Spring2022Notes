What did you learn about GitHub? 
Github let us share our repositories with others. Also, we can collaborate on one projects with other team workers and facilitate the open source projects.
What's not clear? 
I am wondering whether everything we put on the github can be seen by others. Sometimes we may put something we do not want to share, can these stuffs been hidden?
