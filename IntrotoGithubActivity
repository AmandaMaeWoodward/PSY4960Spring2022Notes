What did you learn about GitHub? 
I learned the distinction between GitHub and Git. Git is essentially a version control aparatus that stays on your local machine. GitHub is a cloud-based software
where people are able to collaborate with one another on coding projects. You can also install GitHub on your computer so you can push updates out to everyone 
else working on your project.
What's not clear? 
Some of the vocabulary I still need to review. For example, at the top of this file it says "You’re making changes in a project you don’t have write access to. 
Submitting a change will write it to a new branch in your fork petermgrund/PSY4960Spring2022Notes, so you can send a pull request." My current understanding is that
when I forked this repo, it made a branch that I can edit independently. But since I forked it to my own repo, can I then send a pull request to your original
repo?
