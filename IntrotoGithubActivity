What did you learn about GitHub? 
I learned that pulling a request is much different than what I thought it was. I also learned how to make a new branch off of the main branch, which is very good to know.
I also learned that GitHub is very smart. I felt like it knew what I wanted to do before I did it (which it did, because the intro was decided that way)
but I feel like that may also alude to the fact that Github is designed in a way that is intended to make a lot of sense to the user.

What's not clear? 
I am still a bit unsure of how to make sure I am making edits that aren't editing the main/original document that somebody else created? 
For example, I really don't know if this is going to just stay in my ggrimsrud/PSY4960Spring2022Notes repository or if it is going directly to the
PSY4960Spring2022Notes repository that everybody sees. Should I have made a new branch to edit this? I really don't know.
