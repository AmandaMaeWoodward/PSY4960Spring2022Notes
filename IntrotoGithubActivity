What did you learn about GitHub? 
I leaned that Github is a place people share their idea and work through code and viewers can commend their work to make the original work better.
What's not clear? 
I am not sure I am correctly creating a new pull since each time I clicked on it, the page seems different. And almost all the time I clicked on the button "new pull request", it said "nothing to compare"/
