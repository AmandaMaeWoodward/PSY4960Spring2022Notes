What did you learn about GitHub? 


* Most things make sense conceptually, so I feel that with practice I will understand everything better. 

* One thing I learned about in the GitHub introductory course was that it's a streamlined program to collectively work on group projects. It is also a source that provides open research to other git hub users if the files are made public.

* I learned  so much
What's not clear? 

* I'm not the quickest learner when it comes to technology, I don't really have comp sci experience. I thought it was kind of tough to navigate the site. I am still having a bit of trouble creating pull requests as well.

* I learned how to navigate the basics of the site, though, I am still somewhat confused by everything. I mainly just need practice. 

* The part that is unclear is if there are certain rules of etiquette when collaborating with others. 

* barely anything
