*I learned that GitHub is a Version Control System.  More specifically, I learned that a version control system allows users to continuously edit files without constantly copying them over and creating new files, while still maintaining access to view all of this history.

* Most things make sense conceptually, so I feel that with practice I will understand everything better. 

* One thing I learned about in the GitHub introductory course was that it's a streamlined program to collectively work on group projects. It is also a source that provides open research to other git hub users if the files are made public.

* I learned  so much
What's not clear? 

* I'm not the quickest learner when it comes to technology, I don't really have comp sci experience. I thought it was kind of tough to navigate the site. I am still having a bit of trouble creating pull requests as well.

* I learned how to navigate the basics of the site, though, I am still somewhat confused by everything. I mainly just need practice. 

* The part that is unclear is if there are certain rules of etiquette when collaborating with others. 

*Iâ€™m a little confused about the history saved on Github.  If one were to commit changes and then want to go back, would they be able to recommit those changes if they changed their mind?  Or would you have to be 100% sure everytime you go back on a commit.

* barely anything
