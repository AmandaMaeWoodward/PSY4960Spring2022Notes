What did you learn about GitHub? 
I know that the GitHub is like a cloud-database that can let people share data easily. I learned how to create an issue channel, how to create my own branch, and how to commit a change.
What's not clear? 
It is my frist time using GitHub. It is like the first time I was using R. Numerous buttons totally scary me. I think hopefully I will gradually figure them out.
